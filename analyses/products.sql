--skuid_id is the same as product_id
--product_number: Seems to represent the "base product" or "parent product"
--sku_id and product_id: Represent the specific variants when is_variant = TRUE. (e.g., "Awesome T-Shirt, Blue, L"
--The Anomaly (when is_variant = FALSE)-- Some product_numbers are duplicated. but different updated_at
--What does is_variant = FALSE really mean if product_number can still have multiple distinct sku_id/product_id rows?
--  Could these be historical versions of the base product information? The changing updated_at supports this.
--  SourÄ‡e not immediately obvious from the data alone
